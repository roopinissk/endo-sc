# Immune modulation in endometriosis: Transcriptomic study of endometrial receptivity and implantation

Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory condition often associated with infertility and implantation failure, yet the immunological underpinnings of endometrial dysfunction remain poorly understood. This thesis employs single-cell transcriptomic analysis to investigate the immune microenvironment of the endometrium in patients with endometriosis and recurrent implantation failure.

There were 3 aims to this thesis
1. Characterize the immune cell composition and transcriptional profiles of endometrial tissue in women with and without endometriosis
2. Compare immune profile of two groups: Recurrent implantation failure in patients with endometriosis and without endometriosis
3. Examine the effect of endometrial immune signals on embryo gene expression
